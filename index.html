        Why is Cloud security important?
     </p>
     <br>
    <!-- paragraph 2 -->
     <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
        
With hybrid working now the norm, many organisations are increasingly reliant on the Cloud to ensure their staff can access the data and services they need wherever they are.

However, there are security risks associated with Cloud services.

These are especially concerning as the nature of Cloud computing means organisations will inevitably rely on third parties for some element of their information security.

If you use Cloud services, you need to satisfy yourself of the security and resilience of your Cloud service providers at the trust boundary – the point at which the responsibility passes from your organisation to your supplier.

This is particularly important when it comes to observing your legal and regulatory compliance obligations.

For instance, the DPA (Data Protection Act) 2018 and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) apply to the processing of personal data regardless of where that processing takes place.

If you are a data controller, the Cloud service providers you use need to be able to demonstrate that their technical and organisational security measures comply with the data protection law(s) to which you are subject.

        CSA STAR (Security, Trust and Assurance Registry)
     </p>
     <br>
    <!-- paragraph 2 -->
     <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
The CSA STAR provides a comprehensive framework for Cloud governance and security controls. It complements other standards, such as ISO 27001, by providing a risk-based assessment of Cloud security risks and remediation strategies.

STAR consists of three levels of assurance, which cover four unique offerings based on the Cloud-centric control objectives in the CSA CCM.

Cloud service providers can achieve certification to STAR.

The STAR programme includes a registry that documents the security controls provided by popular Cloud computing offerings.

        Cloud security best practices.
     </p>
     <br>
    <!-- paragraph 2 -->
     <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">
There are many established approaches to Cloud security, including:

The EU Data Protection Code of Conduct for Cloud Service Providers or EU Cloud CoC (Code of Conduct)
The EU approved the Cloud CoC in 2021 to help Cloud providers demonstrate that they meet their obligations under Article 40 of the GDPR.

Covering SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, the Code sets out requirements for business-to-business Cloud service providers that act as processors.

It is supported by a Controls Catalogue that maps these requirements to the GDPR, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, ISO 27701, SOC 2, C5:2016 (Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalog), NIST SP 800-53 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

Declarations of adherence to the Code are overseen by an independent monitoring body, SCOPE Europe.

The EDPB (European Data Protection Board) published its positive opinion of the Belgian Data Protection Authority’s approval of the Code in May 2021.
